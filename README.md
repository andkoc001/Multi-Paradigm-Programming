## Introduction

This is my assignment project to Multi-Paradigm Programming module, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, 2020.

This GitHub repository documents my research, project progress (git version control) and findings of the assignment project - application of various programming paradigms. The intention of the project is to get familiar with selected paradigms approches in solving programming problems.

> The term _programming paradigm_ is the style or the way of thinking about and approaching problems. - Lecture's notes

(here, list the paradigms selected to deal with the task)

## Simulation of a shop

The task of this project assignment is to apply two different programming paradigmns to solve a practical problem, so that each of the paradigms would show their advantages and disadvantages. The selected paradigms are: 

a. procedural paradigm - C language
b. object oriented paradigm - Jave language.

The practical problem is to  built a simulation of a shop. The program is to simulate the cash and stock flow, monitor customers expenditure, etc. (more precise description to be added later)

The following functionality is included into the simulation:

1. Entities: Shop, Customer(s), Product(s), Stock
2. Model the entities
3. Print product info
4. Print customer info
5. Add item to customers list
6. Read in stock from a file
