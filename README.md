## Introduction

This is my assignment project to Multi-Paradigm Programming module, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, 2020.

This GitHub repository documents my research, project progress (git version control) and findings of the assignment project - application of various programming paradigms. The intention of the project is to get familiar with selected paradigms approches in solving programming problems.

> The term _programming paradigm_ is the style or the way of thinking about and approaching problems. - Lecture's notes

As a practical problem, a shop simulation has been chosen. The program is to simulate the cash and stock flow, monitor customers expenditure, etc. (more precise description to be added later)

C programming language is an example of a procedural programming paradigm.
